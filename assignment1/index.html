      <p class="yellow">
        1. The bright background colours were the first things I noticed when
        loading the page. How the text was changing as the colours moved across
        the page in line with the mouse hovering. and each of the sections
        focused on movement
      </p>
      <!-- used ul to make a dot point list -->
      <ul>
        2. In the two minutes i spent with the experience I:
        <li>Scrolled up and down to see how the images would change</li>
        <li>
          Swiped my cursor across the screen to read the different words
          connected to each colour
        </li>
        <li>
          Moved my mouse around to see the sensitivity of the moving pixels
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeatedly hovered over the triangle to see the rotation and change of
          the text
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeatedly hovered over the text at the bottom of the page, rereading
          to see how the letters moved around
        </li>
        <li>
          Clicking on the text and end of the page anticipating something
          happening
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="cyan">
        3. I spent the most time on the first section of the page, moving around
        the cursor to see the different words that would appear in each quarter
        of the colours. It engaged me the longest as it was the most changeable
        and had had deeper interactions for me to discover
      </p>
      <p class="purple">
        4. My most common action while interacting with the page was moving
        around the mouse and hovering over the images/aspects. There wasn't much
        interaction related to clicking or anything else.
      </p>
      <!-- end of div here to encapsulate only the four text blocks -->
    </div>

    <p class="triangle">
      5. I believe the intended goal of the experience is to display the
      artist's ability in movement and interactive coding. Each segment appeared
      to be an exhibit of the range of interactions available within the
      artist's skillset, the links and contact information at the bottom of the
      page reinforce the idea of the webpage being a portfolio of sorts.
      <br />
      <!-- used br to seperate the paragraphs within the same text box -->
      <br />
      6. I think the webpage communicates this goal through the excessive nature
      of all of the aspects. The fact that every detail on the page down to the
      message at the bottom has a movement attached to it, supports the idea
      that the page was designed to show off as many skills as possible. The
      scroll down aspect of the page also gives the impression of a gallery,
      displaying a wide range of the artist's work.
    </p>
    <!-- used div to structure the images to make it easier to centre and add the border to match the paragraphs -->
    <div id="purpletri">
      <!-- linked image to attached file in folder -->
      <img src="purpletri.png.png" alt="image from original site" width="700" />
    </div>
    <p class="triangle">
      7. My impression of how the experience should be interacted with is that
      it is likely designed to be viewed once to provide a quick snapshot of the
      artist's skills and work, perhaps when trying to decide whether to reach
      out to hire them for work. The experience may be viewed multiple times to
      maintain familiarity with the work but ultimately I believe there isn't
      enough detail or interactions to validate spending an extended period of
      time on the page.
      <br />
      <br />
      8. The succinct nature of the webpage and limited examples communicate the
      idea that this experience is intended to be a short snapshot and should be
      interacted with as such. If the experience was intended to be revisited or
      have long periods of time spent on it, it would likely be longer or have
      more interactions embedded in it beyond hovering and moving the mouse
      around.
    </p>
    <p class="blocks">
      9. The experience doesn't seem to reference many other media forms, due to
      the simplicity of the design. The simple design reminds me of old websites
      due to the lack of page borders and the fact that everything exists on the
      one scroll down. The colour palette used in the four colour split on the
      opening screen reminds be of the CMY colour palette which are the
      subtractive primary colours.
      <br />
      <br />
      10. I think that the almost retro feel and CMY reference is communicating
      that the experience is handmade, that the artist made it entirely
      themselves. I think the colour palette implies or references the design
      industry and therefor communicates that the page should be experienced
      through a professional lens and by other designers in the field.
      <br />
      <br />
      11. The general feeling I believe the experience is trying to convey is
      awe and inspiration. I think this is conveyed through the self made and
      professional setting the previous references create, as the artist appears
      to be trying to impress viewers with the skills they are showing off.

    </div>
    <p class="colour1">
      12. The most frustrating part of the experience to me is the lack of
      clickable features. I think that when an asset of a website moves or draws
      attention to itself I want to be able to click it, so it was disappointing
      when there were no additional changes that happened when I tried to
      interact with the page beyond moving around the cursor.
    </p>
    <p class="colour2">
      13. The most satisfying interaction to me was the shifting quarters of
      colours right as you open the webpage. It was satisfying how the colours
      aligned diagonally, and the borders of each colour were continuously
      straight and rectangular.
