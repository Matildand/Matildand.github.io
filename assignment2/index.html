        </ul>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <p>Making the wheel</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Layout your 12.5cm x 12.5cm foam sheet</li>
          <li>
            Fold in half diagonally, unfold, then fold along the other diagonal
            to create four triangle shaped sections.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using your hole punch, punch a hole In the centre of the square
            where the two creases overlap
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut a slit halfway to the centre of the square along each of the
            diagonal creases, so that the far edge of each of the triangles from
            each other while still being connected at the centre.
          </li>
          <li>
            Punch a hole in the bottom left corner of the triangle facing you,
            and rotate the foam sheet 90 degrees. Repeat on each side until they
            all have a single hole.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stick a glue dot next to each of the holes you just punched, towards
            the inside of the triangles
          </li>
          <li>
            Fold one dotted and glued corner into the centre so the two holes
            line up, and press the glue dot down so it sticks to the centre
            corner of its triangle section. Repeat for all four sides
          </li>
          <li>
            At this point, double check to ensure you are able to poke a pipe
            cleaner through the tunnel you have created.
          </li>
          <p>Making the Washers</p>
          <li>
            Layout an off-cutting of your foam sheet in a different colour to
            your windmill.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a glue stick lid, press down like a cookie cutter onto the
            foam sheet to make a circular impression.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use this impression as a guide to cut out a perfect circle, and
            punch a hole in the centre. Repeat until you have two donut shaped
            foam circles we will use as washers.
          </li>
          <p>Putting it together</p>
          <li>
            Layout out a paper straw, a pipe cleaner, two donut shaped washers,
            and your foam wheel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrap one end of the pipe cleaner around the straw 4 times about 15
            cm from the top, so it is securely attached.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thread one of the washers along the pipe cleaner so it sits flush
            against the straw.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thread on your foam wheel ensuring that the flat side is not facing
            out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thread on the other washer to rest against the centre of the foam
            wheel
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut off the excess pipe cleaner, making sure to leave about 15-20 cm
            sticking out from the washer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrap the sticking out pipe cleaner around itself in a flat spiral to
            ensure the washer cannot fall off
          </li>
        </ol>
