      also seemed to be a reoccuring segment so i added a section where they would all be in one place -->

    <!-- I added a cover section as i felt like a craft website would have an easy to read panel that would have 
      important information for people trying to decide what craft to make, like how long it'll take and skill level.

        Welcome to Art hour with the Berry Bunch Family, this week we are going
        to be making the cutest handheld windmills; that actually work! They're
        perfect for weekend afternoons or school holidays when you just need
        something to do, and even once they're made the fun isn't over yet as
        now you have a functional windmill to play with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here at Berry Bunch Family we know the importance of building fine motor
        skills in children, the folding of the paper and the threading on to the
        pipecleaner will help to refine those skills. This craft is also perfect
        because it doesn't make a mess! There's no glitter or sequins or glue to
        get everywhere, all the scrap paper can be used up to make the washers
        and the glue dots make sticking a breeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        We designed art hour to be simple beginner craft ideas that can all be
        done within an hour with easily accessible materials. To check out our
        other art hour tutorials, click on the Art Hour tab on the navigation
        bar.

       I decided to write out a little introduction that i imagine would be included in a blog style post like this.
     This is kind of my take on the long waffeling introductions that cooking blogs often have before you make it to the actual recipe.

            <li>Layout your 12.5cm x 12.5cm foam sheet</li>
            <li>
              Fold in half diagonally, unfold, then fold along the other
              diagonal to create four triangle shaped sections.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using your hole punch, punch a hole In the centre of the square
              where the two creases overlap
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut a slit halfway to the centre of the square along each of the
              diagonal creases, so that the far edge of each of the triangles
              from each other while still being connected at the centre.
            </li>
            <li>
              Punch a hole in the bottom left corner of the triangle facing you,
              and rotate the foam sheet 90 degrees. Repeat on each side until
              they all have a single hole.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stick a glue dot next to each of the holes you just punched,
              towards the inside of the triangles
            </li>
            <li>
              Fold one dotted and glued corner into the centre so the two holes
              line up, and press the glue dot down so it sticks to the centre
              corner of its triangle section. Repeat for all four sides
            </li>
            <li>
              At this point, double check to ensure you are able to poke a pipe
              cleaner through the tunnel you have created.
            </li>
            <!-- I made sure the p element of the subtitles were inside the ol element to ensure

            <p class="bold">Making the Washers</p>
            <li>
              Layout an off-cutting of your foam sheet in a different colour to
              your windmill.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using a glue stick lid, press down like a cookie cutter onto the
              foam sheet to make a circular impression.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use this impression as a guide to cut out a perfect circle, and
              punch a hole in the centre. Repeat until you have two donut shaped
              foam circles we will use as washers.
            </li>
            <p class="bold">Putting it together</p>
            <li>
              Layout out a paper straw, a pipe cleaner, two donut shaped
              washers, and your foam wheel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrap one end of the pipe cleaner around the straw 4 times about 15
              cm from the top, so it is securely attached.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thread one of the washers along the pipe cleaner so it sits flush
              against the straw.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thread on your foam wheel ensuring that the flat side is not
              facing out.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thread on the other washer to rest against the centre of the foam
              wheel
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut off the excess pipe cleaner, making sure to leave about 15-20
              cm sticking out from the washer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrap the sticking out pipe cleaner around itself in a flat spiral
              to ensure the washer cannot fall off
